There was once a normal highschool kid going on a field trip to the Amazon rainforest with his class. As the plane was flying over the dense and lucious green jungle, the plane
started to sputter and started to nose dive. Everyone on the plane was panicking as the pilot tried to gain control of the plane once again, then it crashed straight into the
jungle. Luckily, everyone survived but now they are stranded in the middle of the Amazon without many supplies and with no signal.
(Logan) Now that they were in the amazon, the highschool kid decided it was time to get a tiger for a pet. The highschool kid snuck away from his class and 
hunted for days, searching for a tiger. He became an expert of the jungle in these few days, eventually, gaining the skill to climb to the top of a tree. Once at the top of the tree, he took out his phone. He was able to get recception this high up, and he promptly looked up where to find a tiger in the amazon rainforest. Unfortunately, tiger's are not in the amazon rainforest. He had just left his group for days for nothing!

Lucky for the highschool kid there was a way to order a tiger.
With the last bit of battery on the phone the kid ordered a tiger to be sent to the current location.
After recieving the tiger the kid went back to camp only to realize everyone else did the same thing.
The class then released all of the tigers because they didn't have enough food.
This forever changed the ecosystem of the Amazon rainforest.
