There was once a normal highschool kid going on a field trip to the Amazon rainforest with his class. As the plane was flying over the dense and lucious green jungle, the plane
started to sputter and started to nose dive. Everyone on the plane was panicking as the pilot tried to gain control of the plane once again, then it crashed straight into the
jungle. Luckily, everyone survived but now they are stranded in the middle of the Amazon without many supplies and with no signal.
